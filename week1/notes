ggplot = grammar of graphics

great theme system to polish plot appearance 


LAYERS
1. data - in tidy format + define aesthetics (variables onto plot, axes, shapes, colors)
2. geometric objects (geoms, type of plot)
3. statistical transformations - algorithm used to calc new values for a graph 
4. position adjustment - control fine details of position when geoms might otherwise overlap 
5. coordinate system - change what x and y mean 
6. facet - create subplots that each display one subset of data

ENHANCE LAYERS
1. labels – add / update titles, axis / legend labels
2. annotations – add textual labels (e.g. to highlight specific data points or trend lines, etc.)
3. scales – update how the aesthetic mappings manifest visually (e.g. colors scales, axis ticks, legends)
4. themes – customize the non-data elements of your plot
5. layout – combine multiple plots into the same graphic

TIDY DATA 
- each variable forms a col 
- each obs forms a row 
- each cell is a single measurement 

- The {tidyverse} is an “opinionated” set of packages – meaning they share similar philosophies, grammar, and data structures – that are incredibly useful for data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation (and of course, visualization).
