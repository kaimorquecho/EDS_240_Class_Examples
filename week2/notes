We understand complex numbers better when they're represented visually 

Hierarchy of elementary perceptual tasks
- a viewer performs one or more of these mental-visual tasks (judging position, perceiving angles/areas) to extract the values of real variables represented on most graphs 
- successful charts are constructed based on elemetary tasks "as high in the hierarchy as possible"
- according to this study (about statistical graphs only), color schemes are actually not ideal ways to convey information

Unique visualizations
- creativity, uniqueness can be valuable and powerful even if not aligned with standard practices 

Tips for choosing right graphic form
- think about tasks you want viewers to perform (compare, see flow, reveal connections, general temporal or spatial patterns etc) or messages you want to convey
- consider the number of variables and the numbers of data points + data types to determine appropriate graphic form
- try different things
- arrange graphics components to make it easier to extract meaning 
- test outcome of graphics on others 


Visualizing data distribution = visualize the spread of numeric variable

HISTOGRAMS
- need a numeric variable with lots of values 
- meaningful differences between values 
- bin width (30 bins by default)
- not ideal when we have a lot of groups (i.e all months in a year vs the seasons of the year)

DENSITY PLOTS
- referred to as a smoothed verrsion of a histogram
- representation of the distribution of a numeric variable(s)
  - uses a kernel density estimate (KDE)
